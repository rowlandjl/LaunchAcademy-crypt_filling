Oh no! We forgot to add a few items to `crypt_of_civilization`! We have another
array called `extra` that has a few items:

```ruby
extra = ["container of beer", "Lionel model train set", "Ingraham pocket watch"]
```

After defining the `extra` array like we've done above, 
write a single line of Ruby code that combines the contents of
`crypt_of_civilization` and extra into `crypt_of_civilization`.

{% show_solution %}
```ruby
#provided code
extra = ["container of beer", "Lionel model train set", "Ingraham pocket watch"]

crypt_of_civilization = crypt_of_civilization + extra
```
{% endshow_solution %}
